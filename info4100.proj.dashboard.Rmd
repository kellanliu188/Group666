This project is about developing a learning analytics dashboard based on clicker data. You will work as a team to learn how to make a dashboard using R Shiny (official page with several tutorials: <https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/>).

**Learning Objectives**

1.  Understand the structure of clicker data
2.  Create multiple different visualizations
3.  Design and implement an instructor and student dashboard
4.  Critically evaluate your own dashboard design

You are given aggregated clicker records for a CS course taught at Cornell. There are two datasets: the experience dataset and the quiz dataset.

**Scenario**

You are approached by a college instructor who uses iClickers in her CS class on Business Intelligence. She would like to gain insights about her students and how they are engaging/performing in order to better help them in class. She would also like to better support students by giving them feedback at scale about where they stand and perhaps how they compare to others in the class.

You offer to build a prototype of a dashboard using her clicker data: this is a dashboard for the instructor which offers an overview of the class characteristics, engagement, and performance; and it is a dashboard for students which offers a specific student an overview of their engagement and performance (and how it compares to others).

**Data**

The **experience dataset** contains one record per student who completed the CS course between 2016-2018. There are two sources to this dataset: Faculty Center and a Skills Survey (administered via the Blackboard LMS) where students self reported their skill level for various skills the first week of class. This data has been de-identified. Name, netid, emplid, major have all been removed and replaced with a unique numeric identifier. Note that not all students completed the skills survey, they will have null values for the survey result fields.

The **quiz dataset** contains one record per student per class session held where iClickers were used. Sources used in the creation of this data set include: iClicker session xml files, Blackboard gradebook (for quiz scores), and the Blackboard class schedule (used to map iClicker session to related quiz scores). Note that in some cases there are multiple iClicker sessions / lectures associated with a single quiz. This dataset may be joined to the experience dataset by the student_key field.

# Part 1: Planning / Sketching

Go through the planning / sketching process described in the reading about dashboards. While some dashboards are certainly better than others, there is not one correct solution here. However, spending enough time to make a concrete plan is essential for the success of your project. Everything you do to make the dashboards will be easier if you have a clear plan, especially because you will be splitting up the work and everyone needs to know what they should work on.

**Question 1:** You will make a student dashboard and a teacher dashboard. Carefully consider the implications of this for design and content. To plan, answer the following prompts once for the student dashboard and then for the teacher dashboard. The more concrete you are here the easier it will be later. Focus on the concrete ideas that you will implement in the next steps. You can iterate on this step and modify your responses as your ideas for the dashboard become clearer. You should explore the dataset in R for 5-10 minutes to get a good sense of what the dataset has to offer.

*Planning for the student dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    -   [The student dashboard is intended for individual students enrolled in the BI course. It will provide personalized data to help them understand their own performance and engagement relative to their peers. We pick student number 80]
    -   [Student 80 was a graduate student, with little database background but moderate programming background.]
-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    -   [Provide a clear view of the student's attendance and participation in iClicker sessions.]
    -   [Show individual quiz scores and overall performance throughout the course.]
    -   [Compare their performance and engagement against the class average or specific groups like other graduate students.]
    -   [Identify areas of strength and weakness to guide their studies and preparation.]
-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    -   [Individual session attendance and the proportion of iClicker questions answered versus those available.]
    -   [Aggregate scores and comparisons to class or group averages.]
    -   [Scores from quizzes associated with iClicker sessions.]
    -   [Visualization of skill levels reported in the Skills Survey, contrasting them with the average levels in their program or the entire class.]
-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    -   [line charts showing quiz scores over time compared to the class average.]
    -   [bar graphs comapring the student engagement with the rest of the student]
    -   [Heat maps or color-coded tables indicating attendance patterns.]
    -   [Radar charts to compare the student's self-reported skills against averages.]

*Planning for the teacher dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?

    -   [The teacher dashboard is designed for the course instructor who needs to monitor overall class performance and engagement to tailor teaching methods and identify students who may need additional support.]
    -   [For academic researchers who are interested in analyzing the data for broader educational studies or program improvements.]

-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?

    -   [Provide an overview of class engagement through attendance and participation in iClicker sessions.]
    -   [Help the instructor spot patterns in student engagement and performance for different topics.]
    -   [Visualize overall class performance on quizzes and identify trends or outliers.]
    -   [Offer insights into how different segments of the class (e.g., undergrad vs. grad students) are performing.]

-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?

    -   [Aggregate and individual student attendance for each session.]
    -   [Average, minimum, and maximum quiz scores, as well as variance and trends over time.]
    -   [Distribution of skills as reported in the Skills Survey at the start of the course.]
    -   [Correlations between attendance, participation, and performance metrics.]

-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?

    -   [Aggregate statistics shown via histograms or box plots for quiz scores.]
    -   [Scatter plots or bubble charts to correlate attendance with performance.]
    -   [Line Graph showing the relationship between attendance and performance metrics]
    -   [Heat map showing the skills in the course]

**Question 2:** Based on your plan above, make a sketch of what the dashboard would look like. See this week's readings for examples. Be detailed about what kinds of data points and visualizations you want to see in different parts of the page. Consider the user experience and how you should position more general information compared to more specific information, and where you may need some additional explanation to help the viewer understand a graphic, for example. In your sketch, it is useful to give labels to different objects, because in the steps below you can split up work between team members and the labels will help you connect the UI with the data objects. Show your sketches in section to get feedback from the teaching team.

Each dashboard should contain at least 4 data visualizations. You may include any additional summary statistics (e.g. key percentages or tables).

# Part 2: Dashboard Wire-frame Implementation

This is where you generate the dashboard layout. You are given a very basic wire frame example for the dashboard below. For more information on how R Shiny Dashboards work, look at <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html>. You can add different types of content into a `fuidRow()`. In the starter code, there are 2 rows of content: the first has two little info boxes; the second has two larger viz boxes. You can add more rows and change what is in them as you wish. Follow the naming convention, e.g. `inst.info1` is the first info box for instructors.

Your team can split up the tasks. Some work on creating the UI (this part), while others work on pre-processing the data and creating the statistics and visualizations that will populate the UI (next part).

**Question 3:** Create the layout for the dashboard tabs. You can have as many "tabs" as you like. Each tab is the content displayed when the user clicks on one of the menu items (so it is the page content). Here you are just specifying the wire frame i.e. **what goes where on the pages**, not what goes into it.

```{r}
#######################################
####### BEGIN INPUT: Question 3 #######
#######################################
# Example of a tab (i.e. page)
instructor_dash = tabItem(
    tabName = "instructor",
    h2("Instructor Dashboard"),
    
    # Dynamic infoBoxes
    fluidRow(
      infoBoxOutput("inst.info1"),
      infoBoxOutput("inst.info2")
    ),
    # Any visualization
    fluidRow(
        box(
            title = "Performance Overview",
            plotOutput("inst.plot1", height = 250)
        ),
        box(
            title = "Attendance Overview",
            plotOutput("inst.plot2", height = 250)
        ),
        box(
            title = "Performance vs. Attendance",
            plotOutput("inst.plot3", height = 250)
        ),
        box(
            title = "Temperature Overview",
            plotOutput("inst.plot4", height = 250)
        ),
        box(
          title = "Socres Distribution",
          plotOutput("inst.plot5", height = 250) ),
        box(
          title = "Attendance vs. Average Quiz Score",
          plotOutput("inst.plot6", height = 250)
        )
    )
)

# Another empty tab
student_dash = tabItem(
  tabName = "student",
  h2("Student Dashboard")
)

```

# Part 3: Data Pre-processing

Get the data ready for use in the dashboard. Before the next stage, you want to have the data ready in the right format for simple computations and plotting. To do this effectively, you need to know by now what you want to display in each dashboard. However, this is also an iterative process. Once you have completed a first iteration of the design, you can come back to this step and add further pre-processing for more visualizations you like to add. This step is also an opportunity to better understand the structure of the datasets.

The instructor dashboard should show information for all students. The student dashboard is typically focused on an individual student. You can either pick a student (at random or intentionally) and use them as the "reference student" for the student dashboard. Or, a bit more ambitious but also more rewarding to try out, you can create an interactive dashboard in which you select the student and then the dashboard updates to show the information for that student. I would recommend you start with the simpler version and get that to work before you try to make it dynamic.

Use the space below to be ready for your information visualizations in the dashboards.

# Part 4: Prepare All Data Visualizations

This is where you create the content for the wire frames you created above. Again, you can refer to the examples and documentation in <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html> for guidance. You can also find many examples online just by searching with Google.

**Question 4:** For each of the pieces of content you planned for in the wire frames above, generate the relevant content. You need to assign them all to the `output` variable by referencing the name of the wire frame element you chose above like this `output$name.of.element`.

```{r}
server = function(input, output) {

# Part 5: Produce Dashboard and Reflect

You should be able to simply run the code below **as is** to see your dashboard.

**Note:** Unfortunately, you cannot knit this part into a pdf. So I added `eval=FALSE` to let the knitting run smoothly and you can submit your PDF.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#######################################
### This code creates the dashboard ###
#######################################

# Here we set up the Header of the dashboard
dhead = dashboardHeader(title = "Clicker Dashboard")

# Here set up the sidebar which has links to two pages
dside = dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Instructor View", tabName = "instructor", icon = icon("dashboard")),
    menuItem("Student View", tabName = "student", icon = icon("th"))
  )
)

# Here we set up the body of the dashboard
dbody = dashboardBody(
    tabItems(
      student_dash,
      instructor_dash
    )
)

# Combining header, sidebar, and body
ui = dashboardPage(dhead, dside, dbody)

# Generating a local instance of your dashboard
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

**Question 5:** Add screenshots of your group's dahsboards below using this syntax or simply add them to the Word document after knitting:

![Dashboard Screenshot](example_dash.png)

**Question 6:** Evaluate your group dashboard from the perspective of the instructor (teacher dashboard) and from the perspective of the student (student dashboard). What do you like about it, what would you change or add to it if you had more time?

*Reflection for the student dashboard*
